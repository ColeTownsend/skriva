skriva
======

Skriva is the name of my blog. It's a fork of the awesome Zleek Theme. I had already made the design for tumblr in Sketch. Zleek was similar enough in appearance that I knew I could stitch together some of the code. As I am relatively PHP illiterate, it made the process much easier.

Shout out to [James Dinsdale](http://www.molovo.co.uk/) for helping me out a bit!

To see what it looks like, check it out at my [blog](http://blog.coletownsend.com).

This is my first time using git, so caveat emptor.
